# Analysis

## Layer 8, Head 8

Here, the head is giving strong attention to the relationship between the masked word [MASK] and adverbs in the sentence - in the context of my example sentences, `really` and `fairly`. It suggests it's learnt that the adverb should inform what type of adjective [MASK] might be.

Example Sentences:
- The man was really [MASK].
- That's a fairly [MASK] book.

## Layer 7, Head 4

Here, attention is being given to the relationship between prepositions and the noun phrase (eg. determiner + noun) that follows them. In both examples, the [MASK] and the preceding determiner pay strong attention to the preposition (`on` and `under`, respectively). It suggests it's learnt how prepositions are structured in a sentence.

Example Sentences:
- The cup is on the [MASK].
- Under the [MASK] you will find the dishes.
